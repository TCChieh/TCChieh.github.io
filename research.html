        <p class="abstract">
          More exposure assessment and epidemiological studies are needed for PM1, a health-relevant but understudied pollutant, to better understand and mitigate its health risks. This study conducted a 3.5-year PM1 monitoring campaign in a mountainous community, where air pollutants are more easily trapped, using research-grade low-cost sensors, namely, AS-LUNG-O sets. Nine solar-powered AS-LUNG-O sets were installed at street level, with an additional unit positioned 10 m above the ground to serve as an ambient reference. Street-level sensors were placed 3–5 m from potential sources such as traffic, temples, and vendors. During the 3.5-year period, the overall mean PM1 concentration across the nine street-level locations was 20.9 ± 11.0 μg/m3, compared to 17.0 ± 8.4 μg/m3 at the elevated site. PM1 levels were typically higher in winter and on religious days across all locations. Spatial analysis revealed that PM1 hot spots varied by season, day of the week (weekday vs. weekend), and event type (religious vs. typical days). These hot spots were commonly located near traffic sources, temples, and markets. Notably, most of the maximum PM1 values across the ten locations occurred on weekdays and typical days, highlighting the unpredictable nature of PM1 levels influenced by community events. Source contributions to PM1 were estimated using a generalized additive mixed model; the PM1 contribution from religious events, traffic, and vendors reached statistical significance. The identified hot spots and source contributions can inform targeted control strategies addressing local pollution sources. This study offers a more representative assessment of PM1 exposure for local residents than data from ambient monitoring stations or short-term monitoring campaigns. The methodology presented can also be applied in other countries to support community-based PM1 studies.

        <p class="abstract">
            Urban commuting is one of the most important issues in the development of modern cities. As cities expand, changes in land use patterns lead to increased commuting costs, requiring residents to spend more time and costs traveling between their residences and workplaces. Jobs-housing balance theory indicates that the ideal situation would be employment and residential locations should be in the same area to save commuting time, reduce energy consumption, and air pollution emissions. Previous researches used a variety of annual government transportation or Census data to assess commuting costs and estimate the potential minimum and maximum commuting costs via Excess Commuting in metropolitan areas. However, due to limited data spatiotemporal resolution, there has been a lack of real-time traffic data and spatial visualization. In the development of Taiwan's urban areas, highway construction has played a significant role in connecting cities and suburbs, increasing accessibility between urban and rural areas. Also, promoting rapid population growth and industrial and commercial development in cities along highway interchanges. Since 2015, The Freeway Bureau, Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) has released the Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) dataset, providing improved spatiotemporal resolution. This study utilizes ETC traffic big data to visualize traffic flow spatially. Based on the concentrated distribution of traffic flows, the study classifies five major commuting areas in Taiwan, namely Pei-Pei-Tao commuting area, Hsinchu commuting area, Central commuting area, Tainan commuting area, and Kaohsiung commuting area. Furthermore, it investigates the jobs-housing balance patterns as well as commuting trends within each commuting zone. The results of the data-driven analysis reveal that the majority of commuting zones exhibit a significant jobs-housing imbalance (with an excess commuting index, EC, exceeding 60%), accompanied by a year-on-year increase in commuting costs. Moreover, except for the Tainan commuting area, urban development in other commuting areas is gradually approaching saturation (with commuting potential used, Cu, all exceeding 70%). Hence, this study, through spatial visualization of traffic big data combined with the estimation of excess commuting indices, spatializes the potential of metropolitan commuting and observes the jobs-housing balance within commuting areas. Future integration with land use data could further clarify the changes in urban spatial structures within each commuting area, providing insights for future urban development and transportation planning.

        <p class="abstract">
          Particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 µm or less (PM2.5) poses significant health risks, necessitating comprehensive exposure assessment. Long-term community monitoring can provide representative exposure levels for environmental epidemiological studies. This study deployed nine research-grade low-cost sensors (AS-LUNG-O) for 3.5 years of street-level PM2.5 monitoring in an Asian community, evaluating temporospatial variations, hotspots, and emission sources. The hourly mean PM2.5 concentrations from December 2017 to July 2021 were 24.3 ± 14.1 µg/m3. PM2.5 levels were typically higher in winter, on weekends, and during religious events compared to summer, weekdays, and typical days, with some peak concentrations occurring randomly. Daytime PM2.5 levels generally exceeded nighttime background levels by 30–50%, with certain religious activities causing up to 80% increases. Spatial analysis identified temples and markets as pollution hotspots. Using a generalized additive mixed model, we found that the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown and higher wind speeds negatively impacted PM concentrations. Religious events, traffic, and vendors were significant PM sources, continually influencing community air quality throughout the 3.5-year monitoring period. This study demonstrates the value of long-term PM monitoring in capturing unexpected peaks, identifying critical sources, and revealing intricate temporospatial distributions. Research-grade low-cost sensor networks complement traditional monitoring stations by facilitating source identification in targeted communities and providing representative PM exposure data for long-term environmental epidemiological research.

        <p class="abstract">
          Rapid urban growth extends the boundaries of urbanized areas and makes people spend extra travel cost on the journey to work. Scholars have examined commuting behaviors between residence and work places within a region, and suggested the conceptual theory of jobs-housing balance to evaluate if there are sufficient job opportunities for residents in the region. A quantitative measurement of excess commuting is proposed to reflect the degree of jobs-house balance. However, current studies focus on the evaluation of excess commuting and the causality of spatial restructuring between residence and workplace, the spatial extend of excess commuting in an urban region is not visually delineated. In addition, conventional studies acquire static data such as statistic data or other survey data to analyze impacts of commuting patterns on urban formation. Today the emergence of spatial big data sheds light on the causality of urban commuting from higher spatial and temporal resolutions. This study aims to examine the degree of jobs-housing balance through the calculation of excess commuting and represent the spatial extent of excess commuting of Taichung metropolitan area in Taiwan. Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) data, the spatial big data which is publicly accessible in Taiwan, is introduced as the commuting data and to calculate three key parameters of excess commuting, Tmin, Tobs, and Tmax. The three parameters are used to visualize the extent of commuting zones and examine commuting patterns of Taichung metropolitan area and observe the spatial relationship between those patterns and land-use types. The evaluation of excess commuting indicates that the degree of jobs-housing imbalance in Taichung metropolitan area is similar to Los Angeles metropolis in US. The analytical results explain how ETC data can be successfully used for the calculation of excess commuting, and visualization of the extent of commuting regions. In addition, after the cluster analysis of residential areas, it is intuitive to observe spatial correlation between hot zones of residential areas and the spatial extent of theoretical maximum commuting, and shows that the scenarios of commuting can be considered as an indicator to explain the possibility of urban expansion in the future.
